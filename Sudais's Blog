<h2>How to find out the Theme and Plugins a WordPress site is using?</h2>
<p>So I visited that cool site and found out that it was built using WordPress.Theirs this cool animation slider, an amazing design but how do I do this on my WordPress site?
If you’re a WordPress enthusiast or simply a user and come across a fantastic site built on the platform, you’d want to know what theme does the site use or what plugins make it what it is to make it possible for you.
In such, handy tools come in which allow you to scan a WordPress site to detect what frameworks, themes, and plugins the site is using.</p>

<h2>Create Free Online Testing Installations of WordPress</h2>
<p>Usually, when I have to build a website for a client, I have to install WordPress on my localhost environment using XAMPP.
This involves the process of downloading WordPress from WordPress.org.
Extracting the WordPress folder from the zip file and renaming it to something meaningful to the project.
Placing the folder in the htdocs folder and then creating a database using PHPMyAdmin.
After that, I get to Install WordPress and start developing or testing the site.
But what if I could test changes and new ideas without this time-consuming process all in the cloud free of charge?
Sounds too good to be true?
Well, I recently discovered such a tool named Poopy.Life. Yeah, I know the name sounds cringy but the developers named it that way so that no one would use the free version commercially.It is a product from the team who are also behind the famous WP All Import Plugin & the Oxygen Plugin, a WordPress site builder.
There is also a Pro Version available at WP Sandbox with very reasonable pricing..</p>
